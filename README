1) CERN ROOT veriosn : 6.10.02 works fine 

2) input file : the code expects the input file in txt/dat format 
   this file should have two columns as follows :

          column 1             column 2
   row 1  start of 1st dip     end of 1st dip

   row 2  start of 1st peak    end of 1st peak

   row 3  start of 2nd dip     end of 2nd dip


3) command to run : root -l <file_name.C>

4) key borad inputs : The way this code is written this expects some inputs from key borad.

  A) text file name as <filename.txt> as mentioned in (2).

  B) run number 

  c) Date : at which date the run was taken , as this time line is important in
     BCM Calibration. 

  d) BCM : input BCM Name for which you want to Draw the calibration plots 
     Right Now Hall C has 5 BCMs : BCM1, BCM2, BCM4A, BCM4B, BCM4C.

5) Output : Two plots will be produced  

  A) First one is a two Pannel Plot : Pannel 1-> BCM Rate vs Scaler Time.
     Pannel 2-> will have Unser Rate vs Scaler Time.

  B) Second one is 4 pannel plot : Pannel 1-> BCM frequency vs Unser Current
     p0-> Gain and p1->Offset of the linear fit are the required gain and 
     offset for gscaler file to update.
     Pannel 2-> Residual vs Unser Current
     Pannel 3-> % Residual vs Unser Current
     Pannel 4-> Residual vs Scaler Time
